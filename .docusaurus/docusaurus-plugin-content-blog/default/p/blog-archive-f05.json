It is more of a thing for myself, a way to catch up with things and somehow round up projects and stuff, but maybe you will also find some useful stuff.\n\nThis was the longest season/stage for my studies/adulthood. Prior to this I was distributing my plans through semesters (half a year), but this time season lasted the whole academic year. There was time for trying out as much activities as possible, meet as many people as possible, then there was time for getting some experience for work, going to coding academies and internships, then there was time for working, a lot of working - tutoring, programming, teaching, and then there was time for studying (ofc that is only possible in abroad :)) and seeing the joy of knowledge and science. Then...\n\n2023-09 -> 2024-06 season was for CREATING - doing my own projects, generating ideas, gathering audience.\n\n## Work & Uni\n\nThis was a break from coding job - I only worked as a 10-11th grade maths teacher part-time, tutored about 15 students, had some repetitive coding courses in uni + some meaningless courses for pedagogy. Later I will write here some more detailed desriptions. And also I will later write some built-up opinion about teaching and education.\n\n## TikTok\n\nStarted as a childish thing, when I was uploading funny nonsense videos but, turns out, schoolers are more interested in school stuff (like maths) rather than just doing fun. So yeah, started uploading some maths stuff or just in general sharing my thoughts. Now I have almost 4k followers, 118k likes, the most views on a single video - 170k.\n\nHere's my profile [@naglisaudrius](https://www.tiktok.com/@naglisaudrius)\n\n## vbesort.lt\n\nStarted as just and idea that popped to my head when I realize, there's no sorted Lithuanian math state exam problems on the Internet, that would be accessible to everyone. Made very basic website (learned to use docker, linux server, ssl certificates) with some sorted math problem screenshots, people on tiktok liked it, then made it into a normal website, shared among teachers, they liked it even more. And here we are. Total 20 people donated, in total 264 eur. And it also gave me confidence to share more things on fb teachers groups. And that got me some really cool connections (cool teachers).\n\nHere's the website [vbesort.lt](https://www.vbesort.lt)\n\n## The First Snow - a novel\n\nFinally finished fixing and rewriting my first novel. I've sent it to the Alma littera literature competition, shared the idea of my book on tiktok and got about 30 interested people (and sent the e-copy of the book). I really didn't think that it will gain any attention on tiktok from schoolers. But it did. I guess I broke the stereotype that children these days just scrolls tiktok and don't read, are not interested in reading.\n\nNo matter if I win the competition or not, I will publish the book (possibly in the autumn 2024) and then gonna finish writing 2nd and 3rd parts. Idk yet if in english or lithuanian, and idk if I will stick to my plan to write those parts fully or just gonna adjust it and fix a bit to fit interest of the majority readers. Yeah, idk if I should write EVERYTHING, or should I just write QUALITY.\n\nAlso started writing and planning my next novel - this time in english, and gonna be a normal one. With normal chapters, story, characters etc.\n\nHere's more about the novel [Pirmasis sniegas](https://www.npw.lt/#/write/the-first-snow/)\n\n## Urbex\n\nSome cool friends opened my eyes to the world. To urbex. I climbed up some walls that before felt really unclimable. And explored some abandonned buildings which before felt really wrong, but now it's exciting af. So yeah, it feels like bouldering practice in real world (after climbing gym) + some adrenaline and awesome views. Didn't upload much stuff about it, cuz didn't find it necessary (cuz I have friends to share it with). And also it is not very legal :D\n\n## The Science Guild\n\nOrganized 7 meetings in total - students from various disciplines hosted short lectures about their subject. First (actually, second) meeting had even about 15 listeners, 6 speakers. About computers (how they work), about natural numbers (and REAL math), about geometry, about anatomy, about Lithuania reservoirs, about morphogenesis (emerging patterns on fish skin and math behind it). It was really cool. Sadly, not all meetings gained attention. Turns out it is pretty difficult to find people that would be interested in science just because it is interesting, not cuz of money or experience...\n\nHere's more info: [Mokslo gildija](/docs/teach/the-science-guild)\n\n## Other coding projects\n\nNot done, so not gonna say much about it. But yeah, I had too much time in my hands :D So did a lot of stuff...\n\n- [sci-dict.org](https://www.sci-dict.org) - Science dictionary or \"How to google this in English\"\n- [skafis.lt](https://www.skafis.lt) - Test HTML or PDF generator for teachers\n- [testai.skafis.lt](https://testai.skafis.lt) - Testing system for teachers\n- [bankas.skafis.lt](https://bankas.skafis.lt) - School problem repository for teachers to share, accessible to everyone\n- [koriodienynas.lt](https://www.koriodienynas.lt) - Learning Management System for Lithuania schools\n\nCiao!\n\\- Naglis"},{"id":"/29","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/29","source":"@site/blog/29.md","title":"29","description":"2024-05-08","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:01.220Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.895,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"30","permalink":"/blog/30"},"nextItem":{"title":"28","permalink":"/blog/28"}},"content":"2024-05-08\n\n# Ideas left behind\n\nEN\n\nSince I am planning to abandon some of my ideas (or at least leave it for the future) and dive into other projects and plans with more priority, I am sharing with you my ideas here and in several future blog posts. I'm open to collaboration. Or you can steal the ideas and build things yourself :D As if I care...\n\nOther projects, ideas or just in general descriptions of what I've learned or achieved are not described in this post, so it wouldn't be too dense. There is no need to write them here, since there will be separate posts for that.\n\n## Abandoned ideas\n\n- Caramoi. Mobile app for finding hot, fresh, just out of the oven caramel croissants in a supermarket near you.\n\n- Build my own language with interpreter/compiler. Find the usecase for a new language, choose some kind of realworld analog, maybe do it based on theory and theoretical models of computation.\n\n- Assembly. Analyze one of a few CPUs, maybe write an OS, or create a game with assembly for that computer.\n\n- Digital electronics kit. Educational kit for building your own computer from scratch (well, from transistors, resistors, bateries, wires and LEDs :D). To make a basic summation calculator and/or SAP-1 cpu. Maybe make like a subscription \"box\".\n\n- IoT project with STM32 and C. Maybe something like a GPS tracker. Or like food ordering devices (to beep when the food is made and ready to be taken).\n\n- TimeLoopCave game. 2d and 3d and VR game (learn Blender) where the main character slowly becomes the enemy of the past himself and has to fight that past himself. Also levels with room that is gone through 2 times - first time doing some kind of task, second time - going back to the past, goind through the labirinth and avoiding being seen by the past yourself.\n\n- School geometry paper (with strict axiomatics)\n\n- Computer science for school paper/textbook. Theoretical computer science + computer architecture.\n\n- Vbesort.lt sypnosis of all school math, my problems, list of beyond school math ideas/questions to research.\n\n- Photo to folder. Mobile app that can have multiple app icons (widgets) - each assigned to a certain folder/album. Opens camera and when the photo is taken, stores it in that exact folder.\n\n- E-shop. For sth. Project with real money integration.\n\n- Philosophy. Read books.\n\n- Book of everything. Book about mathematical logic/philosophy applications in everyday world logic/philosophy. My view of the world, but also based on existing (math and science) philosophy. One unified system for everything. Anti-contradiction philosophy would be called. Doesn't include creativity. Only the analysis and work principles of current world.\n\n## Possibly upcoming projects (starting in the end of June?)\n\n- Machine learning basics, basic neural networks, connection between networks and graph theory, connection to probability theory.\n\n- Quantum computing, connection to probability theory, connection to classical computing (computational complexity).\n\n- Parallel computing, measuring computer hardware resourses, measuring computer resources (with all the statistics theory stuff), \"heavy\" algorithms, possibly the same Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, maybe some Bioinformatics (DNA stuff) - make some calculations on computation effectiveness.\n\n- Network security, ethical hacking, (try out most common attacks, ofc, for eduational purposes only :D), encryption algorithm analysis, also comparing to quantum algorithms.\n\nFor all of these projects I will try to use at least some of the \"pure\" math theory, e.g. for networks some theorems of graph theory."},{"id":"/28","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/28","source":"@site/blog/28.md","title":"28","description":"TYPE: NEW","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:01.188Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"29","permalink":"/blog/29"},"nextItem":{"title":"27","permalink":"/blog/27"}},"content":"TYPE: NEW  \r\ndate: 2023-10-05  \r\nlang: EN\r\n\r\n# Het is genoeg.\r\n\r\nI know, the title is not in English. But who cares...\r\n\r\nI though I should write some profound blog posts about the shitty education system in Lithuania, or how the abscence of ability to teach others can be seen also in other environments such as jobs, or even family. But I probably not gonna write anything about that. Cuz that's enough. I's true that writing down your boiling thoughts helps a lot to pursue your purpose, but this time it just gonna take too much time.\r\n\r\nAnd because of that - now is time for my own well-being. That's enough of helping others and trying to drag them with you to open their eyes to the world, like them are open for you, but only you are being kept under a glass cage. So you see everything, but cannot do anything.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna escape that glass cage one day. And it's not gonna be that far. I forgot my purpose, forgot my aim. My aim is to \"exploit\" all my abilities in it's full extent. In other words - I WANT TO REACH THE CEILING. I want to feel what it's like to know that you could never achieve what another person achieved not because you took wrong path of actions, but because you are not capable of doing some of the steps. I want to measure my ability. And then use it in the best way. And not like now...\r\n\r\nI've already measured my timing abilities, i.e. how much I can do at the same time (work 3 jobs, study, have hobbies, make projects etc.). But I don't want to \"waste\" that time doing something that is not including my full capabilities. So now I'm not gonna welcome all the opportunities to take my precious life hours (as precious as they are yours, dear reader - value your time!).\r\n\r\nYeah... That's enough. Het is genoeg. I'm gonna learn dutch, learn finnish, learn french, learn academic english and learn a lot of academic stuff, earn a lot of money (to be able to do all these changes in my life) and become ACTUALLY educated person, that actually knows some science and if only had opportunity, could easily write a scientific article or make a public speach. That's what I'm determined to become. And then I'm gone. Gone somewhere, where I actually need to put a lot of effort to achieve something. Where others are better than me in my field. I'm gonna surround myself with people that gonna push me to go to the stars, to find my \"ceiling\", where I'm not gonna be able to achieve something. AND that's gonna be the moment, when I'm gonna feel whole, knowing my all opportunities, knowing my capabilities, knowing that I CHOSE my life to be like this, knowing WHAT choices I had.\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna be the whole another person. Rising to the sky, to the stars. Academically educated, philosophically educated, communicative and knkowing my reason to go forward, knowing my aims and my abilities.\r\n\r\nSee ya.

O štai čia pilnas paskaitos planelis:\r\n\r\nSS MPS PIRMA PASKAITA\r\nTurinys: 0. MPS medis 1. Įrodymai 2. Logika 3. Aibės 4. Abstrakti algebra\r\n\r\n## 0. MPS MEDIS\r\n\r\n1. Linijinė algebra: 0. Tiesinės lygtys\r\n   1. Matricos\r\n   2. Vektoriai\r\n   3. Determinantai (su kėliniais, keitiniais)\r\n2. Analitinė geometrija:\r\n   1. Vektoriai\r\n   2. Tiesės, plokštumos (lygtimis)\r\n3. Abstrakti algebra:\r\n   1. Ring, group, field\r\n   2. Kompleksiniai skaičiai\r\n   3. Vektoriai\r\n\r\n## 1. Įrodymai\r\n\r\nMatkė, tai įrodymai.\r\n\r\n1. Konstruktyvus: Paprasčiausias (dažniausias). Sukonstruktinam. Every integer >1 can be prime factored.\r\n\r\n   1. Primes arba composite.\r\n      1. p = p\r\n      2. c -> /p -> /p2 …\r\n   2. Prieštaros: -p -> p (galiu but -p -> q -> -q). There are infinite amount of primes.\r\n      1. Finite number of primes and only primes.\r\n      2. Make a number p1\\*p2\\*p3\\*p4...\\*pn +1. Dalinant bus visada liekana 1. Reiskias pirminis\r\n      3. Prie fully defined primes radom dar vieną prime.\r\n      4. Reiskias nebuvo visi primes ten apibrezti. Priestara. Reiskias yra infinite primes.\r\n   3. Indukcijos: Yra visokių (bus strong induction), imam paprastą. Base case, Inductive hypothesis, Inductive step. 2n ≥ n + 5 for n ≥ 3.\r\n      1. BC. n=3. 2^3 >= 3 + 5 TRUE\r\n      2. IH. n=k >= 3. 2^k >= k + 5 LET‘S SAY TRUE (strong induction. With n less or equal k let‘s say true)\r\n      3. IS. THEN n=k+1. 2^(k+1) = 2^k \\* 2^1 = 2 \\* 2^k >= 2 \\* (k + 5) = 2k + 10 > k + 10 > (k + 1) + 5 ALSO HOLDS. Proved.\r\n   4. Bus dar kontrapozicijos\r\n\r\n2. Logika (Boolean algebra)\r\n\r\n   1. Tai va kaip matot atsiranda mąstymas. Tai ko ne suformalizavus ir sugalvojus taisykles, kad lengviau būtų suprasti.\r\n   2. p, q – TEIGINYS = T arba F. p => q = p -> q is TRUE (jei; tada; išplaukia; implikacija; nebutinai priesinga puse). p double-arrow q = p -> q is TRUE AND q -> p is TRUE (tada ir tik tada; jei ir tik jei; ekvivalentumas)\r\n   3. kaip p -> q gali būti true, taip pat gali būti false. Ir turim daugiau tokiu operatorių. Pagrindiniai: AND OR NOT (parodysiu vėliau kur kompiuteriuose pritaikoma, gal kita karta).\r\n   4. AND OR NOT IMPL zymejimai, pavadinimai ir lentutės. Ir tada p -> q = -p V q. Yra ir daugiau desniu ekvivalentumo, kurie parodo, kaip kokionors irodymo teigini galima pakeisti ekvivalenciu.\r\n   5. Kontrapozicija. p -> q = -p V q = q V -p = -(-q) V -p = -q -> -p\r\n   6. Kontrapozicijos įrodymas. Jei n^2 is even, then n is even\r\n      1. KP change: If n is odd, then n^2 is odd\r\n      2. n is odd = E k e N: (ivadas i aibes) 2k+1 = n\r\n      3. n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1. Exists j that 2j+1 = n^2 (j = 2k^2 + 2k)\r\n      4. n^2 is odd. Proved.\r\n\r\n## 3. Aibės\r\n\r\n1. Galiausiai prieinam prie tokių gilių matematikos šaknų ir esminių klausimų, kaip kad „kas yra skaičius“. Ir čia šitam klausimui atsakyti turim arti su logika susietą aibių teoriją. Sugalvotas abstraktus conceptas.\r\n2. Aibė = {a, b, c, c} elementai gali kartotis, tvarka nesvarbi. Sankirta (konjunkcija), sąjunga (disjunkcija), complement (neigimas).\r\n3. Universal quantifier = a galioja savybe ir b galioja savybe ir c galioja savybe…visoje aibeje. Existential quantifier = a galioja savybe arba b galioja savybe arba c galioja savybe …visoje aibeje. (pries tai mineta E k e N).\r\n4. Ir taip su aibėm galim VISKA aprasyti formaliai. Tai ir naudojama matematikoj. PVZ.\r\n\r\n   1. Funkcija – tai aibė, kur kiekvienam x priskirtas y. F = `\\{(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), ...\\}`.\r\n   2. Sąryšis. „lygu“ = `{(2, 1+1), (3, 4-1), (1+1, 2), (3+1, 4), …}`. Kadangi du elementai tuple’e (eil tvarka svarbi) - dvinaris relation. Atsakymas gali buti tik lygu arba nelygu. Kaip ir tuple gali priklausyti arba nepriklausyti aibei. Kaip teiginys gali būti T arba F.\r\n   3. Sąryšiai taip gali turėti savo yptumus. Gali būti:\r\n      1. Transitive. a >= b ir b >= c išplaukia a >= c\r\n      2. Symmetric. NOT: a >= b neišplaukia b >= a\r\n      3. Reflexive. a >= a\r\n\r\n## 4. Abstrakti algebra\r\n\r\n1. Taigi. Viskas tiksliai apibrėžta. Tai galim dabar ir pasakyti kas yra skaičiai ir kokios jiems taisyklės galioja.\r\n2. Yra ivairių algebrinių struktūrų. Pradėkim nuo jum pažįstamos: Racionaliųjų skaičių FIELD (Kūnas :D – čia reklamikė apie sci-dict.lt):\r\n   Field is a set together with two operations (F, +, \\*), where: 1. Closure. + and \\* uniquely define an element of F.\r\n   2 + 3 = 5 (and always only 5) (2, 3, 5 in R) 2. Associativity for + and \\*. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\r\n   2 + (3 + 4) = (2 + 3) + 4 3. Commutativity for + and \\*. a + b = b + a\r\n   2 + 3 = 3 + 2 4. Identities for + and \\*. exists e in F such that e + a = a and a + e = a\r\n   2 + 0 = 2 5. Iverses for + and \\*. exists a^-1 in F such that a^-1 + a = e and a + a^-1 = e\r\n   8 + -8 = 0 6. Distributivity of \\* over +. a \\* (b + c) = a \\* b + a \\* c\r\n   3 \\* (2 + 3) = 3 \\* 2 + 3 \\* 3\r\n3. Galim apriboti, ir neduoti visų savybių. PVZ Z skaičiam negalios viskas. Bus abelian grupe (Z, +): tik closure, associativity, identity, inverse, \\*komutatyvi\\* (ir kad visa savo moksla turi – group theory).\r\n4. ...Bet sitai galioja ne tik skaiciam. Ne veltui abstrakti algebra – t.y. cia a ir b gali buti drambliai arba parašiutai. Šitam kurse tai bus Matricos, Kėliniai, Vektoriai, Kompleksiniai skaičiai.\r\n\r\n   1. Bet tarkim dramblys yra sitas uniquely defined apibrezimas: `S = R \\ {-1} su a \\* b = a + b + ab`\r\n      1. Closure. `a + b + ab = -1  `\r\n         `b + ab = -1 - a  `\r\n         `b (1 + a) = -1 - a `\r\n         `b = -1 (can‘t be)`\r\n      2. Associativity. `(a \\* b) \\* c = a \\* (b \\* c)  `\r\n         `(a+b+ab) \\* c = a \\* (b+c+bc)  `\r\n         `a+b+ab+c+ac+bc+abc = a+b+c+bc+ab+ac+abc`\r\n      3. Identity. `a \\* e = a (e \\* a = a same)  `\r\n         `a + e + ae = a`\r\n         `e + ae = 0  `\r\n         `e (1 + a) = 0  `\r\n         `e = 0 (nes a != -1)`\r\n      4. Inverse. `a \\* b = 0  `\r\n         `a + b + ab = 0  `\r\n         `b + ab = -a  `\r\n         `b (1 + a) = -a `\r\n         `b = -a / 1+a  `\r\n         ` a^-1 = b = -a / 1+a`\r\n\r\n5. Matricos RING:\r\n   Not commuative multiplication.((( (M, +) is abelian group. \\* associativity. \\* over + distributivity. Identity for \\*)))\r\n   Identity matrix. ... Matrix multiplication.\r\n```"},{"id":"/26","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/26","source":"@site/blog/26.md","title":"26","description":"lang: LT","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:01.104Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.605,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"27","permalink":"/blog/27"},"nextItem":{"title":"25","permalink":"/blog/25"}},"content":"lang: LT\r\ntype: NEW\r\ndate: 2023-08-22\r\n\r\n# Studentas-studentui matieka ir kiti mokymo(si) projektai\r\n\r\n## Stud-stud MPS\r\n\r\nNuo rugsėjo pradžios planuoju daryti studentas-studentui matematikos paskaitas VU MIFiečiam (PSam 1kursiam). Bet bus kviečiami paklausyti visi. Panašiai kaip buvo MGBĮ (truputį miręs projektukas - Mokslas gali būti įdomus). Pradinės auditorijos ir tematikos idėja būtų pagal Matematika programų sistemoms I/IIId. kursą (MPS1). Bet ypatingai pirmosios paskaitos būtų adresuotos visiem (baigusiem arba beveik baigusiem 12 klasių), ypatingai pirmo kurso studentam, kurie turį matematikos paskaitas ir nelabai numato suprasti kas dėsis. Daugiau informacijos bus dar vėliau... (bet norisi kuo daugiau žmonių sukviest)\r\n\r\nPirmoji(-ios) paskaita(-os) content būtų kažkas tokio (vėliau įkelsiu šių temų konspektą):\r\n\r\n    0.

Ateity tikiuosi šis dalykas išsiplėtos, nes bent jau man ankstyviame matematikos savarankiškame mokymesi šis dalykas būtų aukso vertas.

Po nelabai nuvykusios MGBĮ iniciatyvos, bandysiu rinkti norinčius mokytis savarankiškai žmones, (?ne-)turinčius tam šaltinius (begalinį internetą :D), bet neturinčius materialaus tikslo / paskatinimo paskatinimo iš aplinkos. Į gildiją surinkti \"meistrai\" galės \"dirbti savo amatą\", t.y. mokytis savo field dalyką, kas savaitę pristatinėjant \"grandis\", t.y. mažus įgilintus mokslo gabaliukus, iš kurių vėliau galima būtų sudėti vieną didelę grandinę...\r\n\r\n...finale pilniau suvokiant pasaulį. nu ir gal koki projekteli tada padarant :D Arba paskaitas/paskaitų serijas išoriniam pasauliui (su tiksline auditorija).\r\n\r\nKadangi tokių žmonių (norinčių savarankiškai mokytis be konkretaus materialaus tikslo) šiais laikais reta, į gildiją galės pretenduoti patekti bet kokie \"amatininkai\", tik tam turės jie pristatyti esantiems gildijos meistrams savo \"šedevrą\", t.y. savo main study field paskaitą (tai nereiškia, kad tik apie tą field ir galės esant gildijoje daryti pristatymus), ir gauti lengvą approve iš vyriausiųjų meistrų (I guess).\r\n\r\n## Konspektai\r\n\r\nPo truputį sukelinėju savo turimus konspektus, bet bent jau šiuo metu neplanuoju jų pilnai užbaigti, mat man pačiam to nelabai reikia, turiu plius minus viską galvoje.

However, this post will be followed by a series of other posts with some ideas I want to share.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, I classify/separate my after school life into stages. The first stage was the my first year of bachelor studies - I just got familiar with the world, did a lot of activities that I couldn't do before, rethinked my life decisions and got a start for software development and teaching carrier (academys, internships, tutoring). Also, measured my limits (by pushing them :D) But I already wrote about this.\r\n\r\n## Second studying stage\r\n\r\n2nd stage was the first semester of second study year. Or how I call it - \"The big money-making burn out phase\".\r\n\r\nI didn't actually have a burn out at that time - it was worse - I was having near-burn-out all the time, never reaching the bottom, always keeping an inch from it, so I could still function. But it was fun. I actually used all my capabilities. Or, in other words, used my limits, that I measured in the previous stage. Yeah, so I was studying the same Software Engineering (I'd also taken minor Pedagogy studies - yeah... didn't get that scholarship), also working part-time (0.5) in Danske Bank as Student Cloud Developer, working part-time (0.6) as a math teacher in Secondary School (also didn't get that money support for new teachers in Vilnius) and also freelance tutoring math (0.4) :)\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna share any time management wisdom or other life coaching bullsh\\*t. It just comes naturally, when you engage in more activities than your short term memory can handle and have responsibilities for other people. Then you don't have any other choice but plan your time.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said, it was fun. I enjoyed (almost) all the things I did and it was a nice experience. I will never forget writing on my time schedule paper the teaching time right on where I'm at office, and then signing the job contract :D I also will never forget my first teaching experience - I thought that someone will guide me and show how the teaching works so I could get used to it, but I was greeted with just a few textbooks, 5 minutes before the first lesson, and basically the words \"Here you go, now go teach some 8th graders math\" :D Then I understood, how much freedom does teaching job give.\r\n\r\n## Third studying stage\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, \"The big money-making burn out phase\" was followed by the 3rd studying stage - the second semester of the second study year. Or as I call it \"The runaway\".\r\n\r\nThe runaway, cuz I left everything behind in Lithuania and went to the Netherlands for studying via Erasmus. It felt as if escaping the chaos and retiring - I had enough money to live by, but also kept the math tutoring online. But the best thing about this \"retirement\" stage is that I could get back to my old hobbies for a bit, and develop/make a start for my numerous ideas, like writing, making a decent website with categorized things I want to share, record some of my compositions, create some games, learn a bit more coding, and the most importantly - have some physics courses and some better quality lectures that you (usually) cannot get in Lithuania, together with some new language learning (I should have A1 level in dutch by the end of semester :)).\r\n\r\nIt also gave me some time to rethink my values. I'm not completely confident saying that I know what I want, but I'm close to that. One think I know - I want to create things. And I think I made a tiny kick-off for that.\r\n\r\n## That's it. Yeah...\r\n\r\nI have a lot of plans for the future, so I'm probably gonna continue being burn-out-level busy :D making some posts about my experiences and some philosophical (and/or fictional) thoughts on that.\r\n\r\nAnd as I said, this post will be followed by a bunch of other general posts about studying and other carrier-directed experiences that I think some people would find useful to learn about. Also about learning in general and other philosophical insights from my experience. So stay tuned :D"},{"id":"/24","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/24","source":"@site/blog/24.md","title":"24","description":"date: 2023-02-18","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:01.004Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.545,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"25","permalink":"/blog/25"},"nextItem":{"title":"23","permalink":"/blog/23"}},"content":"date: 2023-02-18\r\n\r\nlang: LT  \r\ntype: ARCHIVE\r\n\r\n# Vertybės karo akivaizdoje _arba_ Why Marvel movies sometimes make me rage\r\n\r\nPrisijungimo prie blogo slaptažodį truputį pamiršau, tai todėl rašau čia.\r\n\r\nKeista, kad žmonės retai kalba apie karą. Aišku, visai galimas daiktas, kad tiesiog bijo prišnekėt to ko nereikia - vis gi tai yra labai svarbi tema valstybės akivaizdoje. Taigi viskas žmonės drįsta pasakyti, tai “Слава Україні!” ir viskas. Tačiau visi manau gerai susimąstytų, jei, ptui ptui ptui per petį, patuksenti visur kur įmanoma, neduok tu dieve, patys pakliūtų į karo situaciją. Ar tikrai visi patriotiškai kovotų už savo šalį ir (vyrai virš 18) atliktų savo pilietinę pareigą, ar tiesiog dėtų į kojas. Nesiplėsiu į moralės principus politikos akivaizdoje, čia paliksiu spręsti patiems ir galbūt susimąstyti.\r\n\r\nO daugiau norėčiau išsiplėsti ties superherojų filmais. Neseniai žiūrėjau “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” (LIGHT SPOILER ALERT) ir beveik visą filmą tramdžiau pasipiktinimą ir kartais net pasišlykštėjimą. Apart poros sakinių, kurie prisideda prie “Marvel serialo”, visas filmas susidėjo iš šabloninių superherojų filmų elementų. Žinau, kad tai tik filmas, bet sakyčiau pakankamai daug žmonių aplink pasaulį žiūri tokius filmus, todėl sakyčiau tai kažką reiškia.\r\n\r\n1. Žiūrėk, mes turim keletą superherojų, kurie iš esmės galėtų vienu spragtelėjimu padaryt belenką. Tai davai tegu kol jie kariauja, mes suburkim dar papildomai kokią kariuomenę, kuri šiaip sau kovotų, kad tiesiog būtų kažkoks vaizdas, kad pavaizduotumėm, kokie esam didvyriai, ir kaip galbūt po tūkstančių mirčių net padėsim trupinėliu kokiam superherojui. Galima būtų pažiūrėti į tą patį vaizdą iš truputį kitos perspektyvos. Tarkime esi paprastas eilinis ateivis, kariaujantis pagrindinėje masėje, besijausdas didvyriu po motyvacinės kalbos iš kokio random superherojo, kurio gyvybė regis yra daug vertingesnė už betko kito. Ir po kokio atsitiktinio įpykusio blogiečio lazerio ar nuvirtusio pastato tu miršti. Ir ką kiti visi žmonės? net nesureguoja. O jei ir sureguoja, tai tikrai ne pagrindiniai veikėjai. Jie tuo metu spės dar ir kokį juokelį sumesti. Nes jiems nėra ko bijoti, jie ir taip overpowered ir tikrai nemirs. Tai galima ir pasilinksminti.\r\n\r\n2. Žinau, kad tu blogietis (jei tiksliau, šalutinis blogietis) ir kad aš tave iveikiau, bet aš gi geras žmogus esu ir nežudysiu tavęs. Paliksiu tave čiut gyvą ir dar įtikinsiu tave, kad gali būti gerietis. Ir visi žinom, kaip tai baigiasi - that dude dies, spėjęs padaryti kokįnors žygdarbį. Pasiaukoja vardan kitų. Nice. Good job. Neleidau tau taikiai numirti, kovojant už tai, kuo tiki, o įprasminau tavo bevertę gyvybę, panaudojant ją savo naudai. Kai cool. Ai ir jo (čia daugiau specifiška šitam Quantumania filmui), dar ant galo tau prieš mirštant susižiūrėsiu su kuo nors ir šyptelsiu kam nors iš ironijos ar pašaipos, nes mat pasakei kažką kvailo ar juokingo. Nes juk tavo gyvybė nelabai ko verta, palyginus su mano - pagrindinio veikėjo.\r\n\r\n3. You’re a monster. Tu toks super blogas superblogietis, nes mat sunaikinsi civilizacijas, kurios yra kažkur kitose visatose, kur niekad nepasieksiu ir niekad nieko nesužinosiu. Ir tu toks super blogas, nes tu naikini pasaulius, kad išgelbėtum daugiau pasaulių. Tu darai tvarką multivisatoje, bet tu neturi žmogiškų vertybių, tu neužjauti, nepagalvoji apie vargšą pavargusią sraigę ant kelio ir negelbsti jos, kai turi pasirinkimą - tu ją nužudai dėl kažko savanaudiško tikslo išgelbėti keletą visatų nuo susinaikinimo. Tu esi tas negailestingas žmogus, kuris trolley problemoje palenks svertį ir nukreips traukinį ant sraigės, vietoj to, kad paliktų traukinį važiuoti ant 5 visatų. Nes jei tu būtum iš tikrųjų geras žmogus, tu paaukotum visus, ką pažįsti ir ko nepažįsti, įskaitant ir save, dėl tau ant peties verkiančio vieno iš tų pačių draugų. Tik čia esmė tame, kad tau niekas neverkia ant peties. Čia iš esmės yra tasai mygtukas, kurį paspaudus kažkas, ko tu nepažįsti ir niekada nesusidursi gyvenime, mirs. Tik šituo atveju tau paspaudus mygtuką kažkur, kur tu nieko nepažįsti ir niekada nesusidursi, leisi kažkokiam čiūvui palenkti svertį ir leisti traukiniui pervažiuoti sraigę, išgelbėjant keletą visatų. Tai aišku, kad normalus doras žogus nepaspaus to mygtuko ir kovos, kad tik kažkoks čiūvas nepaaukotų tos vargšės sraigės.\r\n\r\n   Žodžiu, atrodo vienu momentu šaipaisi iš prarasų menkų eilinių žmonių gyvybių, o kitu momentu kovoji su “blogiečiu”, kad šis neišgelbėtų keleto visatų, mat tuo atveju jis yra bejausmis.\r\n\r\n   Ir I’m pretty sure dauguma esat susidūrę su šiais epizodais įvairiuose filmuose. Tai sakyčiau kartais susimąstykite ir pažiūrėkite į tą patį vaizdą iš kitos perspektyvos.\r\n\r\n   (Jeez, nejau kažkas skaitėt iki galo…)"},{"id":"/23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/23","source":"@site/blog/23.md","title":"23","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:00.972Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.73,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"24","permalink":"/blog/24"},"nextItem":{"title":"22","permalink":"/blog/22"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT & EN  \r\n2022-08-07\r\n\r\n# The end\r\n\r\nTaigi.

I have no idea why I stopped using English in my posts… The main idea was to write everything in English… Probably I was just too busy and lazy at the same time. Ech, whatever…\r\n\r\nWhere do I begin?\r\n\r\nI should probably point out that this will be kind of boring post. That is what documentations is all about – boringness… No. I should not make it boring.

If I had known how to properly and easily get rid of some activities, I would’ve done it already in February. But at that time I realized – I don’t know how to get rid of activities, how to say no.

Nors, gal labiau pavadinkim atsipeikėjau. Ne, tai nebuvo momentas, kai aš viską prisiminiau – viską, ką palikau praeity neužbaigta su mintimi kažkada sugrįžti. Tai buvo momentas, kai aš po prisiminimo apie tokį neužbaigtą reikalą, pilnai nusiteikiau. Dar nepasiruošiau, bet nusiteikiau. Nusiteikiau sugrįžti į tą vietą, apie kurią vien pagalvojus šiurpas nueina, tačiau tuo pačiu ir pradeda per kūną vaikščioti daug plunksnelių. Tos plunksnelės atmerkia akis, išplečia vyzdžius, nuspalvina visą pasaulį ryškiomis spalvomis ir leidžia pakilti į orą ir skristi.

Tai, ką išmokau anksčiau, tai, ką patyriau tuose stebuklinguose košmaruose yra viskas, ką turiu. Vienintelis būdas kažką daugiau išmokti, tai tik eiti ten ir kovoti. Ir kentėti. Bet nemanau, kad ir šiuo būdu būtų įmanoma kažko daugiau pasiruošti. Telieka tik nerti sapnui tiesiai į nasrus ir tikėtis, kad tuo momentu prisiminsiu viską, ką esu sapnuose ištyrinėjęs vaikystėje. Ir šįkart man pakaks tik įjungti suaugusiojo mąstyseną, kad visas tas pabaisas įveikčiau turint tas pačias senas žinias.

Naujom idėjom, nauju entuziazmu.\r\n\r\nNauji dalykai yra gerai.\r\n\r\nČia šitas mano pasakymas, kad reikia kuo daugiau naujų dalykų ir taip senus, kurie galimai suprastėjo ar išsisėmė, papildyti ir patobulinti, yra siejamas su galvos tvarkymusi. Kai visko yra tiesiog per daug. Ir viskas vis po truputį blogėja. Ir esi įstrigęs senuose dalykuose, juos tobulindamas, juos taisydamas ir stengdamasis sutelkti visą dėmesį į juos, nes, nu, tiek nedaug yra kažkas prastai. Ir reikia vat valią stiprinti, pabaigti neužbaigtą darbą. Tas ilguoju laikotarpiu praranda reikšmę. nebėra svarbu užbaigti kas pradėta, nes tai jau buvo anksčiau užbaigta. Čia jau tik tęsinys po to.\r\n\r\nPavyzdžiui. Mokaisi mokykloje. Supranti matematiką. Pavyzdžiui, 10-oje klasėje supranti kaip veikia matematika ir kaip veikia jos mokymas mokykloje. Viską perpranti – tai nereiškia, kad viską išmoksti, bet tai reiškia, ad žinai kaip tai galima padaryti. Tai ir viskas, palieki tą dalyką. Imiesi naujų. Gauni kažkokį blogą pažymį, tai jau nebetaisai savo mąstysenos ir nesimokai papildomai labai daug. O tiesiog išmoksti kažką naujo. Tam bus tikrai daugiau motyvacijos ir gaoima bus nuveikti daug daugiau.\r\n\r\n(phew… jau maniau nukrypsiu nuo temos. kažkaip išsilaikiau)\r\n\r\nTai toks ir tas recapas abstraktus būtų. Padarysiu kažkada gal atskirus postus savo patirtims įamžinti. Bet dabar suprantu, kad tos patirtys iš esmės nelabai turi reikšmės. Nes jose nėra magijos.\r\n\r\nTaip.\r\n\r\nMagijos.\r\n\r\nNe sūrelio Magijos, o magijos kaip stebuklingumo, spalvingumo, “širdies virpinimo”, erdvumo, gaivumo, ir sulaikyto neapsakomo trykštančio pro kraštus jausmingumo. Tas jausmingumas galėtų būti kažkoks tiesiog labai ilgai galvotas, mintyse formuotas dalykas. Kuris staiga atitiko visus įsivauzduotus faktorius realybėje. O gi tai kas yra galvoje, dažniausiai yra bent truputį magiška. Ar bent jau patampa, kai tai išeina į realybę, o jausmas būna tas pats, tarsi visa tai būtų galvoje. Sapne. Ilgoje kelionėje. Senuose prisinimuose. Išradimuose. Atradimuose. Mįslėse. Paslaptyse.\r\n\r\nPas mane tai prie to turbūt daugiausia prisidėtų Sniegas. Na, tai kūrinys, kuris iš esmės susideda iš mano fantazijų ir įsivaizdavimų, kaip būtų faina jei būtų. Arba kaip viskas turėtų būti, kad keltų tokį fainą jausmą, kaip stebuklingumas. Hmm… Turbūt jau kartojuosi. Self-reference.\r\n\r\nIr tuomet paklausius muzikos, pagrojus į tą ritmą, pajaučiant tą visą muzikos jausmingumą realiu laiku ir savo visu kūnu, prisimeni, kaip viskas gerai skambėjo toje sugalvotoje istorijoje. Senoje istorijoje apie vaiką, atrandantį stebugklingą sapnų pasaulį. Galintį daryti bet ką. Ir atsikartojimus. Užbaigtumą. Ir tuo pačiu užbaigtą neužbaigtumą.\r\n\r\nTaip. Čia svarbiausia. Galvoje tupintis magiškumas, sutelktas į realų tekstą, kuris gali būti sutelktas į reallų gyvenimą.\r\n\r\nUžbaigtas neužbaigtumas.\r\n\r\n(have no idea kodėl iki čia dar skaitai, nusišneku juk, nieko konkretaus nepasakau)\r\n\r\nIr viso to tarp žmonių nėra. Yra tik tavo galvoje. Magiškumas tik tavo galvoje.\r\n\r\nŽmonės ir veiklos – tai yra faina, daug žinių, daug patirties. Bet svarbiausio dalyko – magijos – čia nebūtinai rasi. Ir aš to nerandu. Turbūt reiktų kažką keisti dėl to. Nes gyvenimas būtų toks fainas… DAUG fainesnis… jei jame būtų daugiau magijos.\r\n\r\nNe, ne sūrelio.\r\n\r\nNaglis\r\n\r\n2022-04-21"},{"id":"/17","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/17","source":"@site/blog/17.md","title":"17","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:00.828Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.77,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"18","permalink":"/blog/18"},"nextItem":{"title":"16","permalink":"/blog/16"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT  \r\n2022-04-21\r\n\r\n# emailai yra ziauriai kool\r\n\r\nGalvojau rašyti postą apie veiklas ir savo minčių paskirstymo fazes, bet galva pasisuko kita puse, kai prisiminiau, kad… ech, taip ir nepaklausiau dėstytojo vieno klausimo… Ir sumaniau parašyti jam laišką. Na, elektroninį. Ir tada prisiminiau, kad kaip yra faina rašyti laiškus. Bei prisiminiau, kada tai prasidėjo. Ir taip įklimpau į šitą temą, kuri yra ŽIAURIAI vežanti.\r\n\r\nAtsidarau gmailą. Nueinu tiesiog į pačią laiškų pabaigą. Ir tiesiog einu taip per laiškus nuo galo ir ieškau to susirašinėjimo. Tai buvo dvyliktoj klasėj. Neprisimenu nei vardo nei kažkokių temos raktinių žodžių. Radau. Gabija. Atsidarau. Skaitau. Pasirodo tiek daug teksto esu prirašęs… Ir ji yra daug teksto parašius. Tik truputį paskaitau… ir iš karto ateina prisiminimas: sėdžiu prie per aukšto stalo, žiūriu į aukštai stovintį monitorių su naujo laiško tekstu ir nusiteikinėju jį skaityti ir detalilai nagrinėtis bei pildyti savo atsakymo laišką. Ir po to kaip skaitau. Ir kaip viskas yra aišku, suprantama ir logiška… Ir kaip viskas yra įdomu.\r\n\r\nTruputį konteksto. Arba – grįžkim į pradžią.\r\n\r\n12 klasėj vienintelį kartą dalyvavau fizikos ir matematikos respublikinėse olimpiadose. Apie matematiką nelabai yra ką kalbėti, ten toks fiasko buvo, nelabai ką išsinešiau. Bet fizikos olimpiada… Ką naudingiausia iš jos išsinešiau, tai laiškus su Gabija – nusisprendimą, kad savo kūrinius rašysiu žmonėms visiems visąlaik nemokamai (net jei ir rašyčiau pakankamai kokybiškai, kad tai galėtų nešti pelną) bei laiškų rašymo pamėgimą.\r\n\r\nPo olimpiados uždavinių sprendimo buvo dvi paskaitos – viena apie kažkokias mikro laboratorijas ir lašelius, o kita apie gyvenimą po olimpiadų. Prisijungiau į mikrolaboratorijas – na, ištvėriau iki galo. Ne per labiausiai buvo įdomu, bet ištvėriau. Galvojau ta kita paskaita irgi bus nelabai įdomi. Nesijungiau. Po to kai kiti olimpiadininkai jau nebelabai bendravo, tai sumaniau įsijungt ir pažiūrėt kas ten gero. Ir paklausęs pasigailėjau, kad praleidau pusę paskaitos.\r\n\r\nKembridžo doktorantė kalbėjo. Ir pasirodo ne tik apie mokslą, reklamą ir kitus mokslo dalykus, kuriuos kalbėtojai mėgsta vadinti “įdomiais”. Kalbėjo grynai apie gyvenimą, apie tikslų siekimą, apie tai kas svarbu, kaip rasti kas yra svarbu, rasti tikslus ir panašiai. Ir pačioje pabaigoje laukė klausimų (uždavė žmonės klausimus, tokius paprastus, maždaug – ar olimpiados laimėjimas padės karjerai). Ir po to ji davė el.paštą. Kad jei kiltų klausimų, būtų galima parašyti. Ir padrąsino dar nebijoti ir parašyti laišką jei kas. Dar pasakė, kaip pati laiškus įsidrąsino rašyti.\r\n\r\nTai ir parašiau laišką su klausimu, kuris gan ilgai man kirbėjo galvoje – apie rašymą. Ir pilnai gavau atsakymą. Dar pilnesnį nei tikėjausi. Ir taip keletas laiškų ir susirašėm.\r\n\r\nTrumpai: Laiškai yra žiauriai cool, išsimokslinę žmonės yra žiauriai cool.\r\n\r\nTaip pat po to drąsiau pradėjau formuluoti klausimus ir juos užduoti. Ne per daugiausia tokių susirinkdavo, bet kai būdavo, užduodavau. Ar šiaip jei noriu kažkokį komentarą parašyti, kažką pasakyti, kažkokį feedbacką duoti. Rašau tada laiškus. Nevisada žmonės atrašo. Ne visada išvis turbūt perskaito. Bet koks skirtumas – neperskaitė tia neperskaitė. O jei perskaito ir dar atrašo – tada būna žiauriai cool. Pasirodo su žmonėm tiesiog reikia “kalbėti” ir tada dingsta visos problemos.\r\n\r\nVienas iš tų klausimų, kuris šiandien kilo, yra apie mokslą – ar tikrai visi žmonės automatiškai sieja mokslą su karjera ir pinigais, ar yra tokių, kurie savo nuomonę apie tai kitaip išreikštų – pavyzdžiui, mokslas kelia įdomumą, entuziazmą, saugumo jausmą, formuoja mąstymą, kuris praverstų visame kame. Tai parašiau laišką tam dėstytojui ir paklausiau. Matysim dabar ar atrašys.\r\n\r\nNaglis\r\n\r\n2022-04-21"},{"id":"/16","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/16","source":"@site/blog/16.md","title":"16","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:00.800Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.205,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"17","permalink":"/blog/17"},"nextItem":{"title":"15","permalink":"/blog/15"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT  \r\n2022-04-01\r\n\r\n# slm5\r\n\r\nČia trys tekstai ne dėl to, kad buvau išrinktas į trečią etapą, o tiesiog dėl to, kad buvo mažai žmonių, tai visi buvo visuose trijuose etapuose.

Well, that was f\\*\\*kin painful\r\n\r\nKovo 14 diena. Sėdžiu VU didžiojoje fizikos auditorijoje pirmoje eilėje ir seku ant stalo stovinčio didelio analoginio laikrodžio sekundžių rodyklę. Akies kampučiu galiu matyti, kaip netoliese prie to stalo vertintojo yra tikrinami ant popieriaus surašyti skaitmenys. Viską iki tūkstančio tikrai gerai parašiau. Ten tik toliau neaišku kiek gerai atgaminau, o kiek neatspėjau. Sėdžiu ir laukiu. Gan ilgai tikrina, tai turbūt daug yra gerai parašyta. “Septyni šimtai trisdešimt septyni”. Shit.\r\n\r\nTai turėjo būti pabaiga – šitas apie 1200 skaitmenų išrašymas turėjo būti pabaiga šitai beprasmei veiklai, kuri 9 klasėje neatrodė tokia beprasminga. Tai turėjo viską užbaigti. Bet dabar regis dar metam prasitęs. Tiesa, net jei ir viską gerai būčiau išvardinęs kiek žinojau, tai būtų 1274 skaitmenys. O pirmoj vietoj išvardino 1278. Bet čia nebūtų esmė (manau), jei būčiau viską gerai išvardinęs kiek žinojau. Nes dabar gaunasi tarsi viskas buvo veltui – niekur to neparodžiau.\r\n\r\nNa, gerai. Parodžiau. 10 klasėje. Bet tai nelabai skaitosi, nes tai buvo mokykloje ir dar slegiant tėvų, kurie ne per labiausiai norėjo leisti mokytis kažką tokio beprasmiško. Ir galiausiai net į mokyklos tinklapį negalėjo įrašyti mano vardo. Tai tokia truputį nesąmonė gavosi. Also, jei būčiau tais metais nuvažiavęs į Vilnių ir išvardinęs tą 1000 skaitmenų, būčiau pirmą vietą paėmęs (nu, ten ir piniginių prizų būna, tai dar ir naudos šiokios tokios būčiau gavęs). Bet tuo metu čia buvo net nediskutuotina, turint omeny, kad tik dalinai nuslepiant nuo tėvų galėjau mokytis tuos beprasmius skaitmenis ir sudalyvauti mokyklos renginy.\r\n\r\nAnyways. 9oje (ir biškį 10oje) klasėje mokytis pi buvo fun. Buvo žiauriai cool paimti ir per vieną dieną – per matematikos pamoką neturint ką veikt ir po to grįžus namo vakare – išmokti virš 100 skaitmenų. Kai kitiem tai atrodydavo kosmosas. Ir rašai ant popieiaus viską, užrašai, pasižiūri, wow, taip mirga marga viskas. ir atrodo paimtum kažkokią dalį tų skaitmenų atskirai paskaityti, tai atrodo visiškai random. Neįmanoma čia atsiminti visko. Bet tada vėl sugrįžti prie savo užrašų, kur skaitmenys suskirstyti po du, ir viską atsiminti atrodo taip easy. Lyg visas tas chaosas būtų perkeltas į kažkokį “tvarkos” pasaulį. Ir taip pat yra konkretu ir aišku ką mokytis. Ir tikrai niekada nepritrūks ko mokytis. Sakyčiau 62.8 trilijonų turėtų pakakt.\r\n\r\n9-oje klasėje nepavyko sudalyvauti mokykloje dėl paprasčiausio negalėjimo nusigauti iki mokyklos. 10-oje klasėje sudalyvavau, bet nelabai gavau pakankamai atsako į mano pastangas ir tą įspūdingumą, kurį jaučiau pats rašydamas skaičius. Ir gal tas pasigailėjimas, kad nesudalyvau oficialiame čempionate Vilniuje, kai būčiau pirmą vietą paėmęs.\r\n\r\nIr tuomet va, 2022 metai, po dviejų metų pi čempionato neorganizavimo dėl koronos, kalendorius rodo kovo 7 dieną. Savaitė iki kovo 14 dienos. Ir čempionatas vyksta. Griebiu savo senus užrašus iš 2018ų metų ir…. Ties čia sustoju. Galvoju, galima gi man paprogramuoti, yra daug idėjų projektam, norisi ir žaidimą sukurt, yra daug ir univero dalykų… Ir tiek skaitmenys, kurie iš esmės jokios naudos neduoda…. Kažkaip nesinori juos vėl prisimenant kišti į galvą. Kažkaip jie net patys nelabai lenda. Bet, nu iš principor. Reikia išmokti ir užbaigti tai kas neužbaigta. Ir tada prisiverčiu išmokti vieną bloką skaičių. Apie 100 (tuos, kuriuos 9 klasėj per dieną išmokau). Išmokstu. Viskas. Einu minkštai atsigulti ir valandą pasposot į telefoną. Okey. Kita diena. Nieko neišmokstu. Bet visąlaik apie tai galvoju, ir galvoju kaip reikia gi prisiversti. Kita diena. Prisiverčiu iš vakaro. Išmokstu ten apie 300. Bet žiauriai sunkiai. Galvą net paskaudo. Ir tai tiesiog mentališkai žudo. Po to kažkaip jau įsivažiavau, bet ir tai ne per labiausiai. Norėjosi (kaip jau įpratau univere) padaryti tai tik minimaliai kiek reikia ir kuo mažiau pastangų įdėt. Bet čia taip neveikia. Čia reikia pilnai įdėt pastangas. Kitaip nieko nebus.\r\n\r\nTai ir įdėjau tas pastangas. Vos ne vos kažkaip išmokau tą tūkstantį. Na, ta proga dar į priekį pasižiūrėjau, kiek buvau išmokęs praeitą vasarą. Bet tai buvo painful. Belenkiek galvai painful. Buvo tarsi su kirviu kapoti užbetonuotą žemės plotą. Kapoji, kapoji, bandai į galvą įkišti kažko beprasmiško. Po begalės kapojimo, kažkokį mažą lopinėlį prakapoji. Tai ten ir sukiši viską ką tik gali.\r\n\r\nNe taip paprasta regis pasidarė mokytis kažką beprasmio. Kai mokykloj visa tai buvo, tai buvo ir įdomu ir paprasta ir tikrai atrodė prasminga, nors ir kažkokios naudos pasauliui nenešiau. Jaučiau naudą sau. Man tiesiog patiko. Bet dabar…. Nebe tie laikai. Jau kišti į galvą kažką, kas pasauliui jokios naudos neduoda, nelabai gaunasi. Ir dar atsidavus.\r\n\r\nIr jau galiausiai kai viską išmokau (pasikartojau), atrodė jau tas čempionatas palyginti nieko nevertas. Ir jau net džiaugsmo nebekeltų kai paimčiau pirmą vietą ir dar pinigų gaučiau. Ir jau su tokia nuotaika nueinu į čempionatą. Ir nepakanka to, kad laimėjimas nelabai teiktų džiausmo – aš dar ir nieko nelaimiu.\r\n\r\nPasekmės – dabar mano galva truputį persvilus ir aš absoliučiai nieko nenoriu daryti. Ir noriu tik miegoti, sėdėti prie telefono, miegoti, valgyti, miegoti, miegoti, miegoti, nieko neveikti ir žvelgti į nebūtį, miegoti, miegoti ir miegoti. Ir atrodo giliai visuje norėtųsi tiek daug visko nuveikt, tiek daug padaryt, tiek daug išmokt, bet galiausiai tiesiog sėdžiu ir žvelgiu į nieką. Nes galva yra tiesiog perkepus.\r\n\r\nČia buvo truputį blogas sprendimas. Back in 9th grade būtų geras sprendimas. Dabar – ne. Nebe taip veikia jau galva. Ir šitas beprasmiškumas tiesiog žudo. Ir dabar reikės ilgai ilgai nieko neveikti, kad atsistatyti tą galvos susvilimą. Panašiai kaip buvo po VBE egzų, nes jiem ruošiantis irgi buvo daug, daug, daug beprasmybės.\r\n\r\nIr fsio. Pakanka. Einu žiūrėti į nebūtį, nes čia tokioj smegenų susvilimo būsenoj galiu rašyt be galo.\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2022-03-18"},{"id":"/13","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/13","source":"@site/blog/13.md","title":"13","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:00.708Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.625,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"14","permalink":"/blog/14"},"nextItem":{"title":"12","permalink":"/blog/12"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT  \r\n2022-01-29\r\n\r\n# Trečiasis slemas\r\n\r\nTaigi, dar vienas slemas, kurį dabar pasekė teigiamas greitasis covid testas.

Eiti buvo planuota vieną dieną, o atstumą sakė kad tipo nebūtinai 100 km. Tipo no shit, žmonės, ką, jūs galvojat pririnkti žmonių, kurie norėtų random pasivaikščiodami per dieną nueit 100 km? Na, gal šįkart ačiū. Of course, yra žmonių, kuriem tai nėra kažkas tokio. Man iš pradžių irgi taip atrodė, kai nuėjęs 30 km pajūriu nieko nepajaučiau. Bet damn, čia po kalnelius ir sniegą buvo ką veikt.\r\n\r\nNu, žodžiu, buvo mūsų iš viso 5 lygtai. Bet ties 20km jau buvo visi išsiskirstę, likom tik dviese su kažkokiu žmogumi, kurio nebuvau matęs nė karto savo gyvenime. Bet tai nebuvo esmė. Esmė, kad buvo su kuo eiti, kad ne vienam. Tai va su tuo žmogumi ir nuėjom nuo to išsiskirstymo taško dar 30 km.\r\n\r\nPradėjom žygį nuo 1 punkto ant Stalo kalno(pridėjau žemėlapį), tik ėjom į priešingą pusę, t.y. link antakalnio 10 punkto ir tada 9 ir taip toliau. Baigėm ties 7 punktu kažkur. Prie Akropolio netoli išsiskyrėm ir aš jau nuvažiavau autobusu.\r\n\r\nPora dar dalykų apie ėjimą in general ir tada jau einu ruoštis programavimo atsiskaitymui.\r\n\r\nPirmiausia, tai turėjau tokius gal du ryškesnius ėjimus. Vienas tai pajūriu Latvijoje (40 km), o kitas namo iš Utenos (35km). Pirmas išvargino, bet kažkaip išgyvenau. Antram prireikė ir lazdos, bei batai mano buvo ne kokie, nelabai buvau pasiruošęs tiek eit, tai po to padai truputį kentėjo. Tai čia trumpai taip, pagalvojau nesiplėsiu.\r\n\r\nKitas dalykas, tai galvoju organizuoti daugiau ėjimo. Pvz, kitą savaitgalį bandysiu suorganizuoti ėjimą su draugais, kad tuo pačiu ir traukiniu pavažinėt. Būtų kaip ir su nakvyne, bet bandysiu visiem įtikt. Tai čia dar žiūrėsiu kaip gausis. O po to reikės kažką organizuoti kad kone kiekvieną savaitgalį kažkokį ėjimą. Gal ir su žygeivių klubu kažką sutart bus galima.\r\n\r\nTai tiek. Sutrumpinau pabaigą, nes turiu daug ką nuveikt dar.\r\n\r\nŽemėlapis:\r\n\r\nhttps://vilnius100km.lt/\r\n\r\nPora nuotraukų:\r\n![photo1](./10/1.png)\r\n![photo2](./10/2.png)\r\n![photo3](./10/3.png)\r\n![map](./10/4.png)\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2021-12-05"},{"id":"/9","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/9","source":"@site/blog/9.md","title":"9","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2024-09-12T23:25:00.628Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.67,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"10","permalink":"/blog/10"},"nextItem":{"title":"8","permalink":"/blog/8"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT  \r\n2021-11-29\r\n\r\n# Pirmasis slemas\r\n\r\nManau, pagaliau bent iš dalies sugalvojau kaip išspręsti mano rašymo problemą. Bendriau tai galima pavadinti introverto-ekstroverto vidiniu konfliktu. Jam tada dar priklausytų ir mokslas. Taigi. Problema tame, kad noriu būti ir introvertu ir ekstrovertu. Tik esmė tame, kad abu šitie dalykai užima 100% laiko. Nelabia galima paskirstyti. Gal kitiem ir gautųsi, bet man ne. Arba pilnai ekstrovertas, arba pilnai introvertas. Kadangi introvertiškumo jau buvau paragavęs 11-12 klasėse per karantiną (patiko), dabar kaip ir susidėliojo taip, kad bandau atsigriebti už ekstrovertiškumo nuslopinimą. Ir taip pasirinkęs dabar vis tik galvoju, kaip man rašyti. Kokią sistemą susigalvoti. Parašyti turiu daug ką, idėjų netrūksta. Trūksta tik laiko.\r\n\r\nPasirodo dalinai klydau.\r\n\r\nReikia dar ir žmonių – kažkokio adresato, kuris paskatintų rašyti. Tada daug lengviau prisiversti. Bei tada stiprinasi įgūdžiai. Nes tada tavo iš tikro pakritikuoja, nes rašai ne sau, o kažkam kitam.\r\n\r\nTaigi.\r\n\r\nYra toksai slemas. Apie jį tik neseniai sužinojau. Pasirodo kitiem tai gan žinomas dalykas. Tai žodžiu susidomėjau. Draugė viena paminėjo apie tokį, tai ir užsiregistravau į artimiausią. Parašiau specialiai jam trumpą kūrinuką. Nuėjau. Paskaičiau. Ir atsivėrė man akys. SLEMAS YRA ŽIAURIAI COOL. Ir būtent slemas man padės atgaminti ir patobulinti rašymą. Rašysiu trumpus kūrinukus, kurie (greičiausiai) nebus susiję su Pirmuoju sniegu. Taip tobulinsiu rašymą ir tuo pačiu prisiversiu rašyti (ir tai neužtruks laiko). Ir tuo pačiu dar ir su žmonėm pabendrausiu.

Tik pastebėjau, kad ten žmonės labiau prie humoro linkę savo poeziją/prozą skaityti. Tai žodžiu reikės prisitaikyti truputį prie formato. Bet manau nepražūsiu. Bus įdomu.\r\n\r\n2021-11-29\r\n\r\nP.S. Prisegu savo skaitytą kūrinuką – jis nėra tobulas, bus taisomas, bet dabar kadangi tokį skaičiau, tokį ir įkeliu.

Bet vos už kelių metrų priekyje buvo visiška tamsa. Kažkur lašėjo vanduo. Pasigirdo nuaidėjęs Čarlio balsas. Staiga atsigręžiau į tą pusę, iš kurios jis sklido. Čia buvo betoninė siena. Atsukau telefono ekraną į ją (flashlight’as neveikė). Priliečiau ranka šaltą, kietą ir idealiai lygų sienos paviršių. Atsisukęs į sieną garsiai sušukau, tikėdamasis, kad Čarlis mane išgirs: “Čarli, kur tu?!” Tačiau į mano šūksnį teatsakė tik mano paties aidas, atkeliavęs iškraipytu tembru iš koridoriaus galo. Telefono ekranas užgeso. Neatsukau ekrano, tik paspaudžiau įjungimo mygtuką, ir ekranas vėl užsidegė, apžviesdamas betoną. Tiesiai priešais mane per sieną tekėjo kažkoks juodas skystis. Jo prieš tai tikrai nebuvo. Pakėliau galvą, bet čia tuoj pat baigėsi srovė, tekanti tiesiog iš niekur. Pažvelgiau į telefoną. Šalia žodžio “Nepasiekiama” švietė skaičiai “21:37”.

I am no special person - not some kind of genius, and <!-- truncate --> many others could achieve much more than I had. And everything seems so simple as you get an explanation from peer student. And so damn dificult as you learn everything by the pace of an average Lithianian school.\n\nI tried tutoring, also tried teaching - but is probably seems obvious, that you cannot change a lot in education by makiing difference only when you spend your own time. A lot of your own time. And not using what other people have already created/invented.\n\nThe real answer to this question is long solved. It's called the SDT - Self Determination Theory. It is a psychology theory about what is needed to spark intrinsic motivation to learn or do something. And intrinsic motivation is long proved to be the best type of motivation - motivation which rises within us and cannot be incited with some materialistic rewards, such as a good grade or a great pay. And with this intrinsic motivation students can achive the most. And be happiest and self trusted.\n\nSDT has pointed out 3 main things for intrinsic motivation to appear:\n\n- Autonomy - you need to be able to decide by yourself what you want to learn/do.\n- Competence - you need to do something that that has importance/competence and can be used in the world\n- Relatedness - you need some other people that would do the same / share the same interest\n\nAnd to implement this in real life, I created The Science Guild (Mokslo gildija), where people with similar interest in learning science would gather around (Relatedness) and present what they have learned abot some complex and important (Competence) science stuff, which is, of course, not mandatory, and for which topics to learn are chosen freely (Autonomy).\n\n## Science Dictionary\n\nAnother question that I was contemplating a lot is how could I help students learn math? And what is needed for everyone to get opportunity to have a really good quality education.\n\nIt seems obvious, that the Internet has all the solutions - you could find tutorials for any education topic, and in many different styles. Youtube is STUFFED with really good tutorials. The only problem is - school students usually don't get a vocabulary with Lithuanian-English translations of sometimes complex science terms. And sometimes those translations really doesn't make sense and no way could be googled or translated with google translate.\n\nAnd for that I started making the Science Dictionary LT -> EN (sci-dict.org). Where students could find all the school (and beyond) math terms with translations from Lithuanian to English, and then successfully google, youtube and research in other ways their important school topics."},{"id":"/2021/08/31/collatz-conjecture","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/31/collatz-conjecture","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-31-collatz-conjecture.md","title":"collatz-conjecture","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.725,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"On teaching","permalink":"/blog/on-teaching"},"nextItem":{"title":"trumpai-apie-rasyma","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/26/trumpai-apie-rasyma"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nEN  \r\n2021-08-31\r\n\r\n# Collatz conjecture\r\n\r\n(Better known as 3x+1 problem)\r\n\r\nI’d say this problem sounds pretty easy.\r\n\r\nConsider this sequence: if $a_{i}$ is even, then $a_{i+1} = a_i / 2$; if $a_i$ is odd, then $a_{i+1} = 3 * a_i + 1$. Does all such sequences, starting with positive integer, end up at 1 (contains 1 in them)?\r\n\r\nEventually, no one has ever answered this question (I mean, proven it). This is why it is a conjecture. And, a little suggestion for you – don’t even try to solve it. You’re just wasting your time.\r\n\r\n“Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions.” – P. Erdős\r\n\r\nActually, it is enough just to find a counterexample. One counterexample. A number, from which started sequence goes to infinity or gets stuck in the loop (except the only yet found loop, which contains 1). Well, people checked numbers up to 268 – they all ended up to 1.\r\n\r\nAlso, as you know, there are some problems, that are true and cannot be proven (Gödel’s incompleteness theorems) – maybe this is one of them.\r\n\r\nThere’s also something to do with Benford’s law (something not really significant), so I will be covering this in the future, I guess.\r\n\r\nEventually, I decided to head into other topics in mathematics and computer science. This problem is not worth putting more time in it. Therefore I will end this up here.\r\n\r\nJust last thing I’d like to notice – what if we could make up some kind of “inverse” arithmetic system, in which we could convert/transfer our unsolved math problems, change them in that system, using that systems’ rules (which suits better for the problem), and then convert back to our well-known arithmetic system (something like Taylor series but with it’s own arithmetic rules). I don’t know, maybe someone’s already found something like that, I just have never stumbled upon it. Maybe I should do a research on this idea, before I have invented a bicycle… (As it almost happened with hyperoperations.)\r\n\r\nSome links, regarding Collatz conjecture:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2021-08-31"},{"id":"/2021/08/26/trumpai-apie-rasyma","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/26/trumpai-apie-rasyma","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-trumpai-apie-rasyma.md","title":"trumpai-apie-rasyma","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"collatz-conjecture","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/31/collatz-conjecture"},"nextItem":{"title":"nothing-makes-sense","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/20/nothing-makes-sense"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nLT  \r\n2021-08-26\r\n\r\n# Trumpai apie rašymą\r\n\r\nBeveik kiekvienąkart, kai žmonėm pasakau, kad rašau, turiu dar prie to ir išdėstyti tą patį monologą apie savo neįprastą (ko gero) rašymo būdą. Todėl dabar viską parašau čia.\r\n\r\nPradėjau rašyti 13-os metų, žiemą, paauksuotu parkeriu, sename rusiškame ploname sąsiuvinyje ant stalo teniso stalo (tokio diy). Rašiau dėl keturių dalykų: neturėjau tuo metu ką veikti, norėjau pasimėgauti gerai rašančiu parkeriu, buvau kaip tik neseniai pilnai išmokęs savo noru prabusti iš sapno ir norėjau parašyti kažką, ką pačiam būtų įdomu skaityti (pajaučiau, kokio tipo kūrinys man tiktų, kad skaityčiau). Turbūt išsiplėsti reikėtų tik ties paskutiniu. Na, turbūt įdomu būtų išgirsti ir apie tai, kaip išmokau prabusti, arba kodėl man tai svarbu, bet čia paprasčiausiai taip išmokau po truputį ir to reikėjo, kad galėčiau prabusti iš gan dažnai kankinančių košmarų (po to nelabai ir buvo košmarų – nebuvo reikalo jiem būti, kai tik patekęs į košmarą galėjau prabusti).\r\n\r\nTaigi apie skaitymą. Skaityti nemėgstu. Ne. Ne taip. Skaityti mėgstu, bet tik tikrai geras knygas. Ir tiesiog mano stiliaus. Turiu tik 5 knygas, kurias tikrai man patiko skaityti (na, neskaitant būnant dešimties persaitytą begalę Otfried Preußler knygučių): Antoine de Saint-Exupéry “Le petit prince”, Lois Lowry “The Giver”, Louis Sachar “Holes”, Otfried Preußler “Krabat”, Ernest Cline “Ready Player One”. Viskas. Šiaip, pastebėjau dar tokį dalyką, man patinka skaityti knygas (taip pat ir filmus žiūrėt), kai jau žinau kas įvyksta – kitais žodžiais, mėgstu spoilerius.\r\n\r\nSutinku, kažkur yra ir daugiau knygų, kurios man patiktų, bet, pirma, daug laiko užtruks, kol nuspręsiu, kad ta knyga man patinka (reikės pradėt skaityti, o tai užims daugiau laiko, nei žiūrėt filmą – plius aš gan lėtai skaitau), antra, dabar jau mieliau rašyčiau, nei skaityčiau. Turiu daug idėjų, kurios jau seniausiai turėjo pavirsti tekstu, bet, deja, rašymas yra lėtas procesas – daug lėtesnis už idėjų ir siužeto sugalvojimą (na, bent jau man). Ir todėl dabar aš … nieko neskaitau.\r\n\r\nReikės kažkada pasiimt kokią knygą angliškai paskaityt, vien dėl anglų kalbos tobulinimo tikslų.\r\n\r\nGrįžtam prie rašymo. Tiesa, sakydamas, kad pradėjau rašyti 13-os, tai turėjau omeny grožinę literatūrą. Iš tikrųjų buvau sukūręs porą eilėraščių pradinėje mokykloje. Bet nelabai jų užskaitau kaip rašymo. Taip. Viskas prasidėjo 8 klasėje žiemą. Prisėdęs (nepamenu ar per vieną vakarą) parašiau istoriją apie vieną sapną (apie 3000 žodžių). Iš pradžių ji neturėjo pavadinimo, vėliau sugalvojau pavadinti “Naktį snigo” (tiesiog, susiejau su vienu įvykiu realybėje, net nelabai tiesiogiai, bet man tiesiog skambėjo kūl) – teko prie pavadinimo pritempti biškį siužetą, jį pakeičiant – po to pasikeitė į “Dieną pasnigo” ir tuomet galiausiai į “Pirmasis sniegas”. Taip patobulinau šitą kūriniuką apie sapną (9000 žodžių) ir pilnai sugalvojau idėjas antrai ir trečiai dalims. Antra dalis turėjo būti apie įvykius dieną prieš sapną – tipo susiejimas visų įvykių sapne su prisiminimais. Trečia dalis – sapnas po keleto metų. Parašęs “Pirmąjį sniegą” iškart ėmiausi rašyti antrą dalį, pavadinimu “Pernykštis sniegas”. Rašiau, rašiau, žiūriu, nelabai įdomu net rašyti (galvoje dar sėdėjo užsidegimas su begale idėjų trečiai daliai). Vos dvi idėjas, apart realybėje ir sapne pasikartojančių įvykių, norėjau paminėti. Todėl numečiau. Visa antra dalis patapo tik viena ne per ilgiausia pastraipa trečios dalies pradžioje. Trečia dalis vadinosi “Laiko tirpsmas” (dabar galvoju keisti į “Juodas sniegas” ar kažką panašaus). Taigi, puoliau rašyti trečią dalį. Taip užsidegęs rašiau, kad vos galėjau vietoj nustygti. Visą dieną prie kompo sėdėjau (na, not literally). Rašėsi daug greičiau, daug lengviau, nes buvo daugiau ką pasakyti, o ne tik pritempti gabalą teksto prie kelių idėjų. Ir net keliose vietose atradau tobulą balansą tarp idėjų ir teksto kiekio – idėjų nebuvo per daug, bet ir ne per mažai, ir galėjau visiškai be vargo, laisvai klostyti siužetą ir daugumą net kurti nesuplanuotai, būtent tuo momentu. Ir net pasijautė, kaip kokybė tų kelių epizodų buvo daug aukštesnė nei bet ko parašyto iki tol. Ir taip nenustygdamas vietoje kažkur iki Kalėdų (2017) užbaigiau rašyti savo tobulą 9000 + 14000 žodžių kūrinį, kurį tikrai patiko pačiam skaityti daug labiau už bet ką kito (na, turbūt labiausiai tik dėl to, kad pats žinau kas vyksta ir nereikėjo labai gilintis į tekstą kaip paprasto skaitytojo atveju, jam neturint jokios kitos galimybės sužinoti apie veiksmą apart teksto).\r\n\r\nTik tuomet buvo viena problemikė. Daviau paskaityti sesei. Jai patiko pirmos dalies pradžia, toliau sakė jau kažkokias nesąmones pradėjau rašyt, galiausiai sakė, kad trečioj daly nieko nesuprato. Tik kad patiko viena itš tų mano minėtų vietų. Nu, ką. Pamėginau kažką taisyti, bet nieko nesigavo. Man viskas atrodė tobula. Tai ir palikau taip.\r\n\r\nTuo metu dar šovė kita idėja rašymui. Šįkart tobula. Idėja tobula. Ir tik viena. Todėl labai gerai rašėsi. Irgi greitai. Buvo tik problema su pradžia – nelabia gera gavosi. Maždaug apie vaiką, kuris rašydamas Alias popierėlius išgyvena prisiminimus ir apmąstymus. Vadinasi “Kitas lapelis” (2000 žodžių). Jo netaisiau. Ir netaisysiu. Jis yra gilus, mažai kurie žmonės supranta, bijau kad nesupras daug kas. Todėl, ko gero, jis taip ir neišeis niekada į viešumą. Tik geriem draugam, kuriem tikrai patikiu šitą rašliavą, ją duodu paskaityti. Jos stilius truputį jaučiasi, kad vaikiškas, bet tai kone geriausias mano darbas. Ir jo vaikiškas, neprofesionalus stilius yra dalis to kūrinio. Jo niekada nekeisiu. O kai jį parašiau, jis tikrai pasijautė daug labiau tobulesnis už bet kokį Pirmąjį sniegą ar Laiko tirpsmą. Tai buvo tobulas kūrinys. Ir toks liko. (Sakydamas “tobulas”, turiu omeny priartėjęs prie tobulumo – kadanors noriu parašyti kažką pilnai tobulo. Kad ir trumpo, bet tobulo.)\r\n\r\nIr ties čia mano rašymas baigėsi. Viskas. Kartais dar kildavo idėja pataisyti kažkaip tą Pirmąjį sniegą su Laiko tirpsmu, bandžiau vėl kažką, bet ką daugiausiai padariau, tai truputį pakoregavau pačią pradžią. Toliau nelabai buvo ką taisyti, visa visuma buvo ne tokia. Nebuvo, kaip ją visą pataisyti.\r\n\r\nUntil…\r\n\r\nAtėjo 2019 metų Velykų atostogos ir aš supratau, kaip galima pataisyti tą visą tekstą. Jį parašyti iš naujo.\r\n\r\nTo be continued…\r\n\r\nP. S. Kadanors turbūt pasidalinsiu ir senais Pirmojo sniego ir Laiko tirpsmo variantais. Bent jau man tai būtų įdomu paskaityt kažkieno rašymo senus variantus. Gal ir jum bus.\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2021-08-26"},{"id":"/2021/08/20/nothing-makes-sense","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/20/nothing-makes-sense","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-20-nothing-makes-sense.md","title":"nothing-makes-sense","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2021-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.965,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"trumpai-apie-rasyma","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/26/trumpai-apie-rasyma"},"nextItem":{"title":"ideas-for-the-future","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/15/ideas-for-the-future"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nEN  \r\n2021-08-20\r\n\r\n# Nothing makes sense any more\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I stopped. And pondered. About everything.\r\n\r\nNot only what I want. I think I know it by now – I want to pursue the best I can, I want best I can get. Firstly it’s the education.\r\n\r\nBut also what should I do by know. What I am going to do in the future. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\r\n\r\nSHIT. TELL ME SOMEONE. WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW. WHEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOF EVERYTHING IS IN THE PAST.\r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD I DO???\r\nAlright. Enough. You need some information. About what I am talking.\r\n\r\nSo when I was in Klaipeda (somewhere in the middle of August) I visited, together with my mom, our family friends. I just wanted to have some walk. A trip maybe. Long story short, I wanted to have some load for my legs. And to clear my head. I needed at least 30km walk. That is exactly what I’ve got. 30km walk. And that wasn’t that much as it looked like before. Tbh that was nothing. I needed more. And I’m waiting for more (I’m planning to join a walkers squad, if it is what it called like in English). Anyways, let’s get back to the point. Those our friends – a whole family – were amazed by my state examinations results (I’ve got three 100% evaluations) and asked if I tried to apply to all the prestigious abroad universities. Well. No. I didn’t. You want to ask why? (yeah, that’s what they asked) The answer I gave was simple – when I realized that I want to study somewhere like in Harvard, it was too late. Yeah, deadlines were too close. I couldn’t fit in that time period. Yeah. I thought about that earlier. Like, in November. When I participated in Vilnius University event, called Student For One Day. And that was a nightmare. The main thought was “What the f\\*\\*k, I don’t want to stay here, I should reconsider my carrier pursues”. But there was a few problems. The one that actually twisted my arm was that when I will be accepted, I will actually need to study hard there. Yeah. Then I will really need to LEARN. And there hardly be any free time, which I would need if I wanted to write my novel about dreams, which I really want to write. But there was more in background. That actually affected this situation the most.\r\n\r\nŽmonės, mokykitės ir siekit kuo daugiau. Ir kuo anksčiau. Nebent tikrai žinot ko norit\r\nMan regis, aš tuoj pereisiu prie lietuviško rašymo.\r\n\r\nMy parents’ behaviour all the time was destructing. At first I thought it was just care. A little bit too much of it, but still maternal care. Maybe there still is some of it in my mom’s behaviour but now I realize – it’s all just a f\\*\\*king nonsense. I don’t know how else I could describe it. My parents just want to lecture about how world works, when they by themselves has no idea. Well, they thing they have but actually they don’t. E.g. my mom sincerely thinks, that studying in Harvard is worthless 🙂 Yeah, you’ve read it right. Worthless. Or just participating anywhere is worthless. Or in her words “It develops a strong conceit”. Like you would look down on everyone as you take part in some kind of competitions, like math, physics, debates, or just do some “meaningless” projects. I think I’ve stated my opinion pretty clearly here.\r\n\r\nNow. What’s the impact for the present? Obvious. I can’t get into Harvard. Firstly, I have no achievements other that decent grades and 3 state exams in 100%. That’s all. Despite dozen of my hobbies that have basically never came out in public. So it’s nothing.\r\n\r\nLet’s get back to the point. I dropped this idea about Harvard from my mind in November. Studied for the state exams. Passed pretty well. Visited family friends. And then I thought. Nothing is too late. I can do everything, that I missed, now – It would be harder and more time-consuming, but worth it. I will get engaged in some more public activities, volunteer, participate in various competitions, learn more advanced English (for now my knowledge isn’t very impressive), learn to write essays, get recommendations, write a compelling motivation letter, pass SAT’s, IELTS and try to apply to Harvard or somewhere else next year. If I was declined, at least I will know, that I did my best. If I get accepted – I will have an opportunity to have the best education.\r\n\r\nAnd what I hear now? It is almost too late. For the next year. So there are two options: I take a gap year, dive right into preparing for applications and somehow magically get ready for them until November; or I study for one more year in VU (I will have studied 2 of 4 years by then) and apply to Harvard then and if I get accepted, I will have to start everything from the beginning (2 years of my life wasted :)). And now I have to decide if those 2 years are significant in my life. And what I want. Do I want to stay here in Lithuania or do I want to live abroad. Do I want a basic job with a decent salary, family and happy family life, or do I want to seek more. Longer I wait, less time will be left in my life. And there’s a lot of things I want to do in my life and waste meaninglessly the least of this precious time.\r\n\r\nThere’s also one more way to end this. Admit that my life is an unsuccessful failure and try to make a better life for my children with as less as it can be of my parent’s mistakes. And give them an opportunity I couldn’t have.\r\n\r\nStill Audrius here, from planet Earth\r\n\r\n2021-08-20"},{"id":"/2021/08/15/ideas-for-the-future","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/15/ideas-for-the-future","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-15-ideas-for-the-future.md","title":"ideas-for-the-future","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.06,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"nothing-makes-sense","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/20/nothing-makes-sense"},"nextItem":{"title":"init","permalink":"/blog/2021/07/18/init"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nEN  \r\n2021-08-08, 2021-08-15\r\n\r\n# Ideas for the future\r\n\r\nSo a lot of you was asking in the comments, what I have engaged with recently…\r\n\r\nJust kidding. My website is being viewed by literally one person. And it is me.\r\n\r\nNow about my plans for the future. First of all I should decide WHAT I WANT (I guess it is the same as WHAT I SHOULD WANT). How to achieve it? I need more sociability. Business-like (actually did not find the suitable word for this) sociability. I need to forge some connections between people, who could tell me, what would they do in my scenario.\r\n\r\nI do not expect to happen it just like _snap_ that. I KNOW it is not going to happen like that. Therefore I crave (don’t really know, if this word suits here) publicity, which I was isolated from, crave sharing my activities, hobbies, achievements (first of all – gaining them), which I have loads of and… there are very few, who know them… Basically no one.\r\n\r\nSo. What am I going to do?\r\n\r\nPi\r\nI think you all know that does this greek letter π mean in math. It is basically a constant, which has infinitely many randomly positioned digits after decimal point. And what you can do with whose digits? It’s simple – memorize them. And that’s what I’m going to do. Memorize 13963 digits (you can guess why I’ve chosen such strange number :D) of pi and in March 14th I’m going to write it on paper during pi championship in Vilnius. Well, I actually want to find out if the prize for this (for official record in Lithuania – for now it is 10 003) really is 3,141.59 €. If it is, in my opinion it is quite worth all the effort. Despite the fact, that for me it is easier than for other average person, who thinks it is mind-blowing to memorize that much of randomized digits.\r\n\r\nFor the record (that you wouldn’t think that I am just messing with you), I’ve already memorized about 1170 digits. Here are 1164 digits (that is how much of the second thousand I’ve managed to recite).\r\n\r\nπ ≈ 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 82148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128 48111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196 44288109756659334461284756482337867831652712019091 45648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141273 72458700660631558817488152092096282925409171536436 78925903600113305305488204665213841469519415116094 33057270365759591953092186117381932611793105118548 07446237996274956735188575272489122793818301194912 98336733624406566430860213949463952247371907021798 60943702770539217176293176752384674818467669405132 00056812714526356082778577134275778960917363717872 14684409012249534301465495853710507922796892589235 42019956112129021960864034418159813629774771309960 51870721134999999837297804995105973173281609631859 50244594553469083026425223082533446850352619311881 71010003137838752886587533208381420617177669147303 59825349042875546873115956286388235378759375195778 18577805321712268066130019278766111959092164201989 38095257201065485863278865936153381827968230301952 03530185296899577362259941389124972177528347913151\r\n55748572424542 (I know, the last digit should be 1, but since 5 follows it, it has to be increased for approximation)\r\n\r\nActually, it is not so hard to learn those, if you group them in various groups (depending on what numbers is easier for you to remember) and find as much as possible relations and connections between those numbers.\r\n\r\nTbh, it’s not really the matter of money (well, it is still kinda great to receive a few k euros) – I’m more concerned about the participation in the pi championship; paper, which shows that I was engaged in something, not just laying on a couch and watching tiktok; most importantly the record of my 9th grade free-time activity which wasn’t appreciated at the time (I’ve learned 1000 digits at that time).\r\n\r\nAnyways. In the future I will be writing something more about my pi learning achievements. And maybe I could reveal some tactics I’ve used or will be using.\r\n\r\nDon’t really know in what format I will write in the future, haven’t decided yet. For now I’m just writing some text to clear my mind.\r\n\r\nWriting\r\nYeah. Blog is not the only place where I clear my mind via writing. I am also writing some fiction. I’ve mentioned it before.\r\n\r\nSince I decided to apply for studies the UK and US prestigious universities next year (I guess that would count as a gap year, only that I will be studying at Vilnius university), I have to plan my time better and get rid of some drag out activities – e.g. writing the book called Snow. I’ve planned the whole (almost) plot of it a while ago, so there’s no reason to procrastinate. I should live more active (in hobbies/activies manner) life and get engaged with more things. I will try not to rush too much but I will write in more vivid manner (if everything go as smooth as I expect).\r\n\r\nFirstly, I am going to edit whole piece of text (of 30,000 words), which is the first part of story. Wish this won’t take long and will increase the quality of text. And then, as soon as I finish editing the first part, I am going to head straight to the second part which about one third I’ve already written of. But for now let’s just end the first part so that my friend could finally read it.\r\n\r\nTeaching\r\nSo there exist one thing that worth mentioning – I love explaining and teaching something, that I’ve learned and really understand. I’ve helped some of my friends with math – I didn’t even requested any money (well, except when I had to spend some particularly for the tutoring), I was happy to help.\r\n\r\nBut I’ve also realized something – it takes not so little time to explain everything needed for math state exam (in Lithuanian “VBE”). And also I have other things to do – don’t want to waste too much time on this (especially unpaid). Therefore in near future I will post somewhere that I am tutor and I can teach math (also physics and IT) and earn some money. And also I will try to do this legally, paying all the taxes, so I could have a paper that says “Audrius actually was teaching”.\r\n\r\nThat’s it for the future plans. This is the beginning.\r\n\r\nThese posts… It might look boring for now. Because I am writing only text. Without many images. I will add them in the future posts. More and more. And the text is not very structured and formal. But for now let’s keep it that way.\r\n\r\nP. S. I was recently considering writing future posts in two languages (Lithuanian also). Doubtful, but maybe this idea will suceed.\r\n\r\n![photo](./ideas-for-the-future/1.png)\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2021-08-08, 2021-08-15"},{"id":"/2021/07/18/init","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/07/18/init","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-18-init.md","title":"init","description":"ARCHIVE","date":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.41,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ideas-for-the-future","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/15/ideas-for-the-future"}},"content":"ARCHIVE  \r\nEN  \r\n2021-07-18\r\n\r\n# def **init**(): #Intial Post\r\n\r\nWow.\r\n\r\nYou’ve actually reached the Initial Post. Yeah. That’s the first post.\r\n\r\nSo… Today I’ve finally created a blog website. This is due to the changes that are being made in my life (yeah, not some drastic changes, just going to start studies in Vilnius university and live (finally) not with my family). Therefore I realized that I have LOADS of things to do – learning Computer Science (the list is long), writing fiction (unfortunately, for now only in Lithuanian), learning languages, making software development projects, learning electronics and making projects…\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn’t mentioned Computer Science so abstractly. There’s A LOT in Computer Science. For now, I’m planning to learn about Software Development life cycle, OOP, .NET, DSA, and Game dev (probably with Unity or just with some raw Java libraries and raw theory of Computer Graphics).\r\n\r\nAbout writing fiction. Yeah. I haven’t decided yet about that. Maybe I should just share stories written in English. Or maybe I should translate them (that’s a lot of work). Of maybe I should make some kind of section, where would be the only place in this website, where everything is written in Lithuanian. But, I guess, that would be weird. Or maybe not.\r\n\r\nSome more things to notice. Besides all learning stuff and gained knowledge (that I want to share), I’ll also share something about maths, physics, … Well… everything. I’ll share everything. I mean… Not ENTIRELY everything. But a lot of stuff. I wish so… Who knows, maybe this will be the only post in the entire dead website, or maybe this will be the number one blog in the entire world…\r\n\r\nAudrius\r\n\r\n2021-07-18"}]}}
