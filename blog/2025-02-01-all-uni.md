# My whole university experience

> Post in progress...

My bachelor studies are coming to the end - it's the last semester, writing bachelor thesis. So here's all the courses with short structure, my opinion and how it adds up to the whole image of knowledge.

Addressing mainly to the high school students in Lithuania, to be able to choose studies and survive them more easily.

## Pre (in school)

My field is computer science. But I am also interested in pure math and physics, but didn't want to study those, just because I thought the work after studies would be boring and only programming is feasible.

For the learning part, of course, I am not talking about the regular curiculum. Here I describe everything that I learned additionally (almost everything from YouTube).

1. **Math**. Polynomials, complex numbers, calculus, mathematical logic. You can find more keywords and descriptions on this page: [The Science Guild > Science Can Be Interesting](https://thescienceguild.com/student-mini-lectures.html)

2. **Physics**. Electromagnetism (with Maxwell's equations), special relativity basics, particle physics basics, digital electronics.

3. **Computer science**. Programming in Java, logic...
